# adaptablegrid
The Adaptable Grid is a JavaScript based grid control.
It contains all the functionality that users expect in a basic grid and has a well-written API allowing developers to add their own filtering, sorting and searching functionality as required.
The Adaptable Grid works well with the Adaptable Blotter.
